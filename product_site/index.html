            <p> Homely is a place where homebuyers can anonymously apply for loans, securing the best loan terms possible
                We partner with local, regional, and national banks/lenders to offer homebuyers a streamlined application
                process.
                Our software prepopulates mortgage forms with your information, allows lenders to bid on your loan, reduces
                bias by anonymizing demographic information, and makes capital available quicker.


                Some notable benefits of using homely:
                <ul>Quicker access to funds </ul>
                <ul>Stress-free loan application process</ul>
                <ul>Bias-free application process</ul>
                <ul>Automated forms save you time and money</ul>
                <ul>Free to use until you successfully close on your home</ul>
