            <p> Homely is a place where homebuyers can easily compare mortgage.
                We partner with local, regional, and national banks/lenders to offer homebuyers a streamlined application
                process.
                Our software prepopulates mortgage forms with your information, allows lenders to bid on your loan, reduces
                bias by anonymizing demographic information, and makes capital available quicker.
                Some notable benefits of using homely:
