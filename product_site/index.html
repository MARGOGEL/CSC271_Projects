            <p> Homely is a place where homebuyers can easily compare mortgage.
                We partner with local, regional, and national banks/lenders to offer homebuyers a streamlined application
                process.
                Our software prepopulates mortgage forms with your information, allows lenders to bid on your loan, reduces
                bias by anonymizing demographic information, and makes capital available quicker.
