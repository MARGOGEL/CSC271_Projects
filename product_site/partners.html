    <h4>Who are our partners?</h4>
    <p>
        Homely partners with banks and financial institutions of all sizes to give homebuyers access to an online mortgage marketplace.
        Our platform allows homebuyers to apply for mortgages and compare offers from various lenders using a marketplace bidding system. 
        We allow mortgage loan officers at competing banks to view each mortgage application, negotiate, and offer their best terms to 
        the prospective homebuyer. While we do partner with larger banks, we hope to forge more partnerships with many local banks to 
        create a system of community benefit.
