        <h1>How Homely Works</h1>

        <p>Homely is a web-based platform created for homebuyers. We believe that the mortgage process is fundamentally flawed.
            The traditional process for buying a home is tedious, frustrating, and stressful. We have developed a new approach
            to apply for mortgage financing that streamlines the process, from loan origination to closing. Conventionally,
            purchasing a home requires extensive amounts of time sending documentation to lenders and discussing financial information.
            However, many people find that their financing options are limited and often accept the first bank that approves them for a mortgage.
            Despite this, there may be other lenders out there that are willing to offer more competitive loan terms.</p>

        <p>Applying for a mortgage takes time and effort. The typical mortgage application process for each lender may take between 30 and 45 days.
            In fierce housing markets, long approval windows give other homebuyers an advantage, creating a first-come-first-serve environment.
            Gathering financial documents and paperwork for each mortgage lender may take substantial amounts of time.</p>

        <h2>Our Solution</h2>
        <p>We believe that the process of buying a home should be stress-free, and that homebuyers should have access to financing that
            fits their financial situation. Accepting a loan with unfavorable terms may cost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars over the
            life of a loan. We believe that homebuyers should not be limited in the number of lenders they have at their disposal.</p>

        <p>Our solution: an online mortgage marketplace centered around homebuyers. Using our platform is simple:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>A homebuyer creates an account and links their financial information.</li>
            <li>The homebuyer submits a universal mortgage application to our loan marketplace.</li>
            <li>Local, regional, and national lenders view these applications and express interest based on limited financial information
                (credit score, income, downpayment amount, etc.).</li>
            <li>Interested lenders submit formal requests to view and access complete financial information from homebuyers.</li>
            <li>Users can either approve or deny lender requests.</li>
            <li>Lenders approved to view an applicant's financial information may offer formal loan bids.</li>
            <li>Users compare bid offers and negotiate loan terms between selected lenders.</li>
            <li>Users that choose to accept loan terms with a particular lender proceed with the loan underwriting process.</li>
            <li>Users and lenders finalize the mortgage process, and mortgage funds are disbursed.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="features">Homely Features</h3>
        <p>We use tools that gather information from submitted forms to prepopulate user financial profiles, making it easy for anyone to
            sign up and view lender offers. We offer the ability for homebuyers to anonymize some of their demographic information on their
            Homely account. We believe that the mortgage application process should be free of bias, and removing demographic information
            like race, sex, and gender may allow for more equal access to financing.</p>
