    <h1>How Homely Works</h1>


    <p> Homely is a web-based platform created for homebuyers. We believe that the mortgage process is fundamentally flawed. 
        The traditional process for buying a home is tedious, frustrating, and stressfull. We have developed a new approach
        to apply for mortgage financing4 that streamlines the process, from loan origination to closing. Conventionally,
        purchasing a home requires extensive amounts of time sending documentation to lenders and discussing financial information. 
        However, many people find that their financing options are limited and often accept the first bank that approves them for a mortgage. 
        Despite this, there may be other lenders out there that are willing to offer more competitive loan terms. 

    </p>

    <p> Applying for a mortgage takes time and effort. The typical mortgage application process for each lender make take between 30 and 45 days.
        In fierce housing markets, long approval windows give other homebuyers an advantage, creating a first-come first-serve environment.
        Gathering financial documents and paperwork for each mortgage lender may take substantial amounts of time.

    <h2> Our Solution</h2>
    <p>
        We beleive that the process of buying a home should be stress-free, and that homebuyers should have access to financing that 
        fits their financial situation. Accepting a loan with unfavorable terms may cost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars over the
        life of a loan. 
        We beleive that homebuyers should not be limited in the number of lenders they have at their disposal.
        
        Our solution:
        an online mortgage marketplace centered around homebuyers. 
        Using our platform is simple:

        A homebuyer creates an account and links their financial information
        The homebuyer then sumbits a universal mortgage application to our loan marketplace
        Local, regional, and national lenders view these applications and express interest based on limited financial information
        (credit score, income, downpayment amount, etc.)
        Interested lenders then submit formal requests to view and accessm complete financial information from homebuyers
        Users can either approve or deny lender requests
        Lenders approved to view an applicant's financial information may offer formal loan bids
        Users may compare bid offers and negotiate loan terms between selected lenders
        Users that choose to accept loan terms with a particular lender may then proceed with the loan underwriting process
        Users and lenders finalize the mortgage process and mortgage funds are disbursed

    <h3 id="features"> Homely Features</h3>
    <p>
        We use tools that gather information from submitted forms to prepopulate user financial profiles, making it easy for anyone to
        sign up and view lender offers.
        We offer the ability for homebuyers to anonyize some of their demographic information on their Homely account.
        We believe that the mortgage application process should be free of bias, and removing demographic information like race, sex, and gender may
        allow for more equal access to financing.
